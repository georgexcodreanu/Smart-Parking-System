# Smart-Parking-System

# Introduction
This project is an automated parking management system based on Arduino that monitors and displays available parking slots, allows vehicle entry using sensors, and controls an automatic barrier.

The purpose of the project is to simplify the parking management process in small or medium-sized areas by providing an accessible and efficient technological solution.

The idea came from wanting a better way to keep track of free parking spaces and make it easier for drivers to find one quickly.
